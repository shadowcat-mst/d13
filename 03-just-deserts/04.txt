At 3am, "fun" ensues.

Sirens active. Perimeter breached.

I grab my rifle and climb the tower.

Morgan and Yeager are both very much awake but close in defence is their
thing so leaving them to it and climbing the tower is in fact not just
the sensible thing for me to do but what they'd want me to do anyway.

First idiot through the fence while I'm still climbing learns the hard way
that Morgan's extremely useful abilities to heal people in the field can
also work in reverse as his knee blows out and he drops.

The rest of the first group to try and break through get a thorough reminder
that no matter how clever you think, lead poisoning is bad for your health.

As the second group tries to break through, Yeager rips her blouse open
(there was a reason I aksed for multiple copies of that blouse) and multiple
knives rise from the bandolier attached to the underlying vest, spin
briefly in mid air and then bury themselves in the eye sockets of the
attackers.

Group three is only two idiots.

Trouble for us is that every weapon they hit them with isn't doing anything.

Trouble for them is that now I'm at the top of the tower.

Turns out a .300 Winchester Magnum incidiary round to the face is in fact
quite effective at inconveniencing your average vampire.

The UK Army people responsible for that base are very much happily to offer
dustpan and brush service to deal with the resulting dust so we can go back
to bed.

Nobody minds letting me and my team getting the rest of a night's sleep.
