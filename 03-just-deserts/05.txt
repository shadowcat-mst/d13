Thing is ... there's only one way to get them out in the open.

"So, the only way I see this working is to provide bait."

Morgan and Yeager are both far more excited by this than I would like.

Nevertheless, they are neither of them wrong.

So we go forth.

Vehicle, driver on loan (I'd rather have had Bishop but what can you do),
Morgan in the front, Yeager and I in the back.

Naturally we get half way through patrol and then the IED goes off.

Driver: Dead. Very. Sorry, mate.

Morgan: Mangled, will probably live, no time to check.

Me and Yeager? Time to move.

So we move.

As we move the vampires move in. I take a couple of shots and watch the
fucking idiots burn.

She destroys another blouse and this time she demonstrates that the knives
were only the 'ha ha only serious.'

This time she hits the other side of her bandolier ... you think molotovs are
bad? Try bottles full of Everclear laced with shreds of paper as an easy point
of ignition for a pyrokinetic.

Not long before all the minions are dead.

And then she drops.

And then I recognise the one also who's still upright.

"Oh for fuck's sake, not you again."
