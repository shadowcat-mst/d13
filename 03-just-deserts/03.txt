The chopper lands.

Fine.

Morgan has his kit, Yeager actually looks fine. Hopefully this will be fine.

I am -so- screwed.

Oh well.

We land at the forward base and it's probably ok.

Naturally as external people, no, we do not get to dine with the officers,
we dine with the troops.

Not honestly minding because the troops we -do- dine with are actually
sensible and good people.

But part of why we're here is to keep an eye of shit ovenight.

This might get "fun".
