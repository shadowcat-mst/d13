Helicopter.

Helicopter over a desert.

Six and the DIA had called for help.

Rotors thrum as we head towards the nearest UK base.

Four of us in the back.

Me, Samson, Morgan, and Joy Yeager.

You haven't met her yet, I know. I'll get to it later.

For the first time since I've met him, Samson isn't wearing a suit.

Then again for the first since since he's met me, neither am I.

We're both wearing desert camo and both shifting uncomfortably because, well,
sufficiently well tailored uniforms aren't a thing on this short notice.

Morgan's wearing desert style combat pants and a suitably coloured sleeveless
T-shirt ... which, well, close enough.

Yeager looks like a good girl, and Samson and I both almost died to achieve
that, but like I say, I'll get to that part later.

Meanwhile, we're most of the way to what's going to be initial home base.

"Is there anything we need to know about that first base?"

Yeager: "Stark, surely you should know at least as much about first base as
I do."

Morgan clenches his jaw.

Samson: "British army base in the relevant combat zone, primary headquarters
  for the losses we're here to figure out, nothing beyond that that anybody's
  bothered to tell me, which honestly I presume is why we're here."

Ah.

[and the helicopter continues to make its way across the desert]

"Pilot? 100 yards height. Now."

Samson just ... ok?

The chopper drops.

"Stark? You're field lead until I get back."

I have about two seconds to curse under my breath and then Samson jumps out
of the fucking chopper.

Without a parachute.

The way he lands is ... not mangled, as such, but not expectedly survivable.

The chopper pulls up and away and I stare out the window ... and a minute or
two later, he stands up and sprints away.

Morgan and Yeager both grin at me, both mostly sympathetically, as I watch.

WHAT

fg

"Yeah, he does that." says Morgan.

"... sir."

Oh.

Oh, shit.
