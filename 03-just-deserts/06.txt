I thought I killed x4le already.

On the upside, I do have my computer shit in the fucked hummvee.

And it begins. Again.

Diving into the system, into the space.

I know how this works and the thing is I -am- better than him and he
-is- going to lose.

It's going to be hard work and it's going to hurt but nevertheless.

He and I fight even so and he has more compute behind him so it's harder but
I am still convinced he's going to lose anyway because I don't care how much
compute you have behind you I -am- better at it.

Then there's a really loud noise, my auditory and visual shit gives up
 ... and as usual I pass the fuck out.

Oh well.
