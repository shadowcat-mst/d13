Handguns? What do you think we are? Americans?

More seriously, if we ever hit a problem where handguns would be useful,
it's time to retreat and call back to HQ to deploy people more suitable to
the problem.

Even more seriously, even if we don't hit that problem, no, we would really
rather not piss off Five.

Our alliances are essential to our survival and I already annoyed GCHQ last
week and just because -that- happened to work out well in the end doesn't
mean taking such a risk again with a major security service is a remotely
good idea.
