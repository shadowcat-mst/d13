Fuck.
Once he'd had time to unmangle himself, it took Morgan a while to unmangle me so I could hear again.  Much appreciated, mind.
What actually happened ... was Samson showing up with a Challenger 2.  
British Main Battle Tank with a 120mm rifled gun and a HESH round.

HESH would be High Explosive Squash Head.

Idea being that it hits a target and it kinda squishes and then goes bang,
and in the case of a tank or whatever it causes what's called spalling, where
bits of the internal armour break off and ricochet around the inside of the
tank and said result is militarily effective but really not pleasant.

On the other hand, x4le taking a HESH round to the face from a british MBT?

Probably not pleasant for him but beautiful to watch for me and I can be
pretty confident I'm never going to have to deal with that shit again.

Perhaps not morally ideal but also "bye bye motherfucker."
